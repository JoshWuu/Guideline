## GuideLine is an augmented reality tool that visually guides users through the breadboarding process.

🧠 **Inspiration**  
As students who run a robotics club, we’ve seen the same thing happen over and over again:  
New members join, excited to learn electronics — but the moment breadboards and schematics come out, they freeze.  
The diagrams are confusing.  
The connections aren’t clear.  
One small mistake can break everything.  
Eventually, they give up — not because they lack potential, but because the tools fail them.  
We built GuideLine because everyone deserves a chance to build and learn without being held back by bad UX and intimidating tools.

💡 **What It Does**  
GuideLine is an augmented reality tool that visually guides users through the breadboarding process.  
- Upload a schematic (from Fritzing, KiCad, or EAGLE)  
- Point your phone at your breadboard  
- See glowing highlights showing exactly where each wire and component goes  
- Follow step-by-step instructions until your circuit is complete  

It’s like a GPS for electronics.

⚙️ **How It Works**  
- AR & Computer Vision detect and calibrate the physical breadboard layout  
- Schematic Parser extracts wiring instructions and component locations  
- Real-Time AR Overlay lights up individual holes for each connection  
- Step-by-Step Mode guides the user through each placement with optional haptic feedback!

🏆 **Accomplishments**  
- Functional AR interface with real-time wiring overlays  
- Accurate schematic parsing from Fritzing exports  
- Breadboard recognition using corner detection + homography mapping  
- Optimized mobile performance to maintain 30 FPS with AR overlays

📚 **What We Learned**  
- Computer vision + AR is way more fragile on mobile than we expected  
- Robust schematic parsing across platforms (Fritzing, KiCad, EAGLE) is non-trivial  
- UI/UX matters as much as the tech — if users don’t trust it, they won’t use it  
- Cross-functional collaboration is essential in CV, AR, and mobile development

🚀 **What’s Next for GuideLine**  
- Add support for more schematic formats (e.g. KiCad netlists, JSON)  
- Build a real-time feedback system to detect incorrect placements  
- Integrate with education platforms (classroom/curriculum support)  
- Launch a community schematic library for beginners  
- Polish the UI, expand to iOS, and test in schools & makerspaces
